# Inaccessible

It's not hard to find inaccessible websites to test, but having something more consistent and reliably broken should make evaluating tools easier. This site is intended to cover as many obvious accessibility failures as possible, organized by WCAG success criteria.

## Getting Started

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and `npm` (included with Node.js) to build the site and run it in local development. The LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended for most cases.

Here are the main commands you'll need to run to get the project up and running.

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the site in development mode
npm start

# build the site for production
npm run build

# lint your code for possible issues
npm run lint

# run unit tests
npm run test
```
